### Question 1

#### 1.1

**Download the dataset: download Genomes_per_week_in_England.csv from Canvas. This includes weekly counts of virus samples per lineage over time across England collected as part of Sanger Institute COG-UK.**

```{r downloadDataset}

# Import COG-UK daily genomic sequence data
COGdata <- read.csv(here("data", "Genomes_per_week_in_England.csv"))

# Check the input format and display the first few rows of the data
head(COGdata)
```

#### 1.2

**Classify major lineages: identify the following variants as major lineages: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.4, BA.5, BA.5.3 (BQ.1), and XBB. Group all other lineages into a single category labelled as Other.**

```{r setMajorLineages}

# Specify the major lineages
major_lineages <- c("B.1.1.7", "B.1.617.2", "BA.1", "BA.2", "BA.2.75", "BA.4", "BA.5", "BA.5.3", "XBB")

# Cleaning the data
COGclean <- COGdata %>%
  # Ensure collection_date is in Date format
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  # Grouping all non-major lineages as 'other' 
  mutate(lineage = ifelse(lineage %in% major_lineages, lineage, "Other")) %>%
  # Rename columns for clarity
  {colnames(.) <- c("collection_date", "major_lineage", "lineage_count"); .}

# Check the format of the columns after cleaning the data and displaying the first few rows of the data

head(COGclean)
```

#### 1.3

**Visualise the data: generate a stacked area plot showing the total counts of each major lineage over time. Generate another stacked area plot showing the frequencies (proportions) of each major lineage over time.**

```{r frequencyData}

# Calculate total counts per date
total_COG_counts <- aggregate(COGclean$lineage_count, by = list(collection_date = COGclean$collection_date), FUN = sum)
colnames(total_COG_counts) <- c("collection_date", "total_count")

# Merge total counts back into the lineage summary
COGclean <- merge(COGclean, total_COG_counts, by = "collection_date")

# Calculate frequencies
COGclean$lineage_frequency <- COGclean$lineage_count / COGclean$total_count

# Display the first few rows of the new data frame
head(COGclean)
```

```{r 10dayBins}
# Aggregate lineage frequencies into 10-day bins
# Converts the Date values into numeric format, where each date is represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01 (the Unix epoch)
COGclean$collection_date_bin <- as.Date(
  floor(as.numeric(as.Date(COGclean$collection_date)) / 7) * 7, origin = "1970-01-01"
)

# Aggregate lineage counts for each 10-day bin
COG_summary_binned <- aggregate(
  lineage_count ~ collection_date_bin + major_lineage,
  data = COGclean,
  FUN = sum
)

# Calculate total counts within each bin
total_COG_counts <- aggregate(
  lineage_count ~ collection_date_bin,
  data = COG_summary_binned,
  FUN = sum
)
colnames(total_COG_counts) <- c("collection_date_bin", "total_count")  # Rename for clarity

# Merge total counts back into the binned data
COG_summary_binned <- merge(COG_summary_binned, total_COG_counts, by = "collection_date_bin")

# Recalculate frequencies
COG_summary_binned$lineage_frequency <- COG_summary_binned$lineage_count / COG_summary_binned$total_count

# Preview the binned data
head(COG_summary_binned)

```

```{r stackedPlots}

# Set a colour blind friendly colour palette
palette <- c4a("safe",10)

# Make stacked area plot for total counts of each major lineage
countPlot <- ggplot(COGclean, aes(x = collection_date, y = lineage_count, fill = major_lineage)) +
    geom_area(position = "fill") +  # Create a stacked area plot
    scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +  # Apply the custom palette
    labs(
      title = "Total counts of major lineages over time",
      x = "Collection date",
      y = "Total count",
      fill = "Major lineage"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()

##this doesn't seem quite right?


# Make stacked area plot for frequencies of each major lineage
frequencyPlot <- ggplot(COG_summary_binned, aes(x = collection_date_bin, y = lineage_frequency, fill = major_lineage)) +
    geom_area(position = "fill") +  # Create a stacked area plot
    scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +  # Apply the custom palette
    labs(
      title = "Frequency of major lineages over time",
      x = "Collection date",
      y = "Proportion",
      fill = "Major lineage"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()

# Printing the two plots
grid.arrange(countPlot, frequencyPlot, ncol=2, nrow =1)
```

### Question 2

#### 2.1 

**Visualise the COG-UK and ONS-CIS data for BA.2: plot the frequency trajectory for the BA.2 variant using both the Sanger dataset (weekly counts) and the ONS-CIS dataset (10-day bin counts from the practical).**

```{r ONSdataSetup}

# Import ONS-CIS daily genomic sequence data
ONSdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mg878/variant_fitness_practical/main/lineage_data.csv")

# Ensure collection_date is in Date format
ONSdata$collection_date <- as.Date(ONSdata$collection_date)

# Create new data frame 
ONSsummary <- aggregate(
  ONSdata$major_lineage,
  by = list(collection_date = ONSdata$collection_date, major_lineage = ONSdata$major_lineage),
  FUN = length
)

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(ONSsummary) <- c("collection_date", "major_lineage", "lineage_count")

# Calculate total counts per date
total_ONS_counts <- aggregate(ONSsummary$lineage_count, by = list(collection_date = ONSsummary$collection_date), FUN = sum)
colnames(total_ONS_counts) <- c("collection_date", "total_count")

# Merge total counts back into the lineage summary
ONSsummary <- merge(ONSsummary, total_ONS_counts, by = "collection_date")

# Calculate frequencies
ONSsummary$lineage_frequency <- ONSsummary$lineage_count / ONSsummary$total_count

# Display the first few rows of the new data frame
head(ONSsummary)
```

```{r ONS10dayBins}
# Aggregate lineage frequencies into 10-day bins
# Converts the Date values into numeric format, where each date is represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01 (the Unix epoch)

```

#### 2.2 

**Analysis: compare the two trajectories. Is there a difference in the timing of BA.2’s rise and when it reaches fixation? Reflect on potential reasons for these differences (sampling strategies and geographical or temporal biases in data collection)?**

The two trajectories are almost identical, with BA.2 first appearing at the start of 2022, rising to fixation around 3 months later. The ONS peak for BA.2 is slightly ahead of the COG data peak. One reason for this could be that the ONS data was collected from all individuals, whether symptomatic or not, whilst the COG data was collected from patients. This means that the ONS data would have picked up cases before they became symptomatic, whilst the COG data may have a small delay due to the time taken for cases to become symptomatic.

### Question 3

**Using the Sanger dataset, determine which variant—B.1.617.2, BA.1, or BA.2—reached fixation the fastest and exhibited the highest selective advantage under a logistic growth model. Use weekly counts to measure the selective advantage (𝑠)**

```{r logisticGrowthFunction}
## logistic growth function

## do i need this defining parameters section? if so need to determine what they should be!!
# Define parameters
N <- 1e5          # Population size
s <- 0.1          # Selection coefficient
f0 <- 1 / N       # Initial frequency of the variant
tmax <- 200       # Maximum number of generations
t <- seq(0, tmax, by = 1) # Time in generations 

# Logistic growth equation
logistic_growth <- function(t, s, f0) {
  (f0 * exp(s * t)) / (1 + f0 * (exp(s * t) - 1))
}
